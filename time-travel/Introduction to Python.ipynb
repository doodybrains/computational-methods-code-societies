    "We bend powerful forces to our will and even conjure new concepts and applications into existence merely by typing the proper incantation. Yet what is \"proper\" can be surprisingly difficult to determine even for folks with decades of experience. And although our abstractions can come to seem quite remote from their physical moorings, I encourage you to always remember that these machines are made out of metals and stuff just like a knife is, consume scarce resources such as electricity for the construction and functioning, and that \"the cloud\" is ultimately just someone else's computer.\n",
